    "legal_text": "<p><strong> SIMANFOR </strong> was developed by the University of Valladolid with the collaboration of other research centers, and  programmed by s|ngular (for additional information, see credits and citation). The developers reserve the right to update and translate the system in all future versions. Use of <strong> SIMANFOR </strong> is free and open to scientific and technical forestry communities. SIMANFOR may be used for research, education, and development of sustainable forestry management systems. Interested parties are encouraged to link the system site to their personal site or institutional web page. Use of <strong> SIMANFOR </strong> for any activity should be acknowledged with a corresponding citation. Registered users are responsible for the reliability of results obtained through use of the SIMANFOR system; SIMANFOR does not offer an express guarantee.</p><p>There are three types of registered users on <p> <strong> SIMANFOR </strong>: administrators, model makers, and users. The first administer the system and its permits. Model makers may upload and create models using the system. Users may develop forestry management scenarios using the models uploaded to the system. All users are responsible for protecting their own username and password (Do not share your username or your password with anyone!). If you decide to register as a user, the system will send you an email with information on how to register.</p><p>Model makers may, assuming all responsibility, upload models to the system and maintain the models in beta stage for a time, inaccessible to other users. Once the trial period is past, the model makers must offer free use of the models to all registered users. If, after a reasonable period of time, determined on a case-by-case basis by the administrators, the model maker does not release a model for all users, the administrators will automatically release this model. Model makers implicitly accept these terms. The model makers are responsible for the reliability of the system models and their corresponding documentation.</p><p>Users may develop, import and export data using the system, and develop sustainable forestry scenarios. Users implicitly accept that in order to ensure smooth system functioning and maintenance, their scenarios and data procedures will be registered in order to optimize future system requirements (for example, repeating searches of public data, simulating tested scenarios, etc.). The users are responsible for the reliability of their scenarios, the data integrated into the system, and the documentation relevant to each scenario.</p><p>The developers will not be responsible for special or indirect damage, or any consequence derived from inability to use the program, or any loss of data or benefits derived from use or utilization of the SIMANFOR system, or for the information contained in the system. The developers may close the accounts of users who have been inactive for at least three months.</p><p>External links that may appear on SIMANFOR are not controlled by the developers and therefore the developers are not responsible for the contents of any linked sites, nor for any possible updates or changes related to those sites. Developer approval is implicit in any included link.</p><p>These terms of use will be regularly updated. Users are encouraged to periodically review this document for changes. If you have any questions or comments regarding SIMANFOR, or require additional information, please contact the developers (in Spanish or English) via email at simanfor.forest [at] uva.es. We make every effort to respond adequately.</p>"
