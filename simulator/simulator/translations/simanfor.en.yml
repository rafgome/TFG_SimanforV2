Values below 2 are considered low in diversity, and values above 3 indicate high species diversity.

This value represents the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample belong to different species.

    # Vorest variables
    w_voronoi: Weights used to construct the Voronoi diagrams 
    neighbours_mean_dbh: Mean dbh of the neighbour trees (cm)
    ogs: Occupied growing space of tree i in year t, computed as the area of the weighted Voronoi region of the tree i restricted by the range of its zone of influence (radius) at time t
    ags: Area in its surroundings not occupied by neighboring trees and therefore available to that tree to search for light
