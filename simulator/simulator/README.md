That directory contains the following information:  
   
* config_files: script to logging
* files: scenarios ready to be used on SIMANFOR. They correspond to scenarios created to different aims:
  * CROSSFOREST: scenarios developed to be used on the CROSSFOREST proyect. 5 different scenario types were programmed, and IFN information is used to simulate them
  * DRP: scenarios used to the IV Chapter of Diego Rodriguez de Prado PhD. They are used to study the evolution of mixed and pure stands on different climate change predictions, evaluated from 2000 to 2100
  * GO_SIGCA_PPin: scenarios developed to test the Pinus pinaster atlantica models under different conditions, to compare SIMANFOR simulations with other softwares  
  * non_wood: scenarios created by using real silvicultural models developed by Catalonia Forest Service, in order to study the production of non wood products under different management conditions
  * TFM_aitor: scenarios created to validate IBEROpt and IBEROps models (Aitor Master Thesis)
* src: folder with SIMANFOR scripts
* tests: folder that contains files to realize different tests after SIMANFOR updates
* translations: language files to translate SIMANFOR output
  
**install.sh** file contains the information to install SIMANFOR requirements  
**requirements.txt** contains the list of Python libraries needed to run SIMANFOR
